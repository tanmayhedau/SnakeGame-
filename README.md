# SnakeGame-

What is a snake game? What are we going to use in it?
A snake game is an arcade game that involves a snake moving inside a box. Your score increases based on how many objects/fruit the snake eats. This will also increase the size of the snake. If it collides with itself or to the boundary of the box then the game is over.

We are going to use the following tools to build our game:

Redux: To create and manage the global state for the application.
Redux-saga: A redux middleware we'll use to manage async tasks.
Canvas HTML tag: We'll use this to draw an object like a snake and the fruit.
React: UI library.
Chakra-UI: Component library.
